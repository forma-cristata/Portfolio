 * 
 * This file extends the base TypeScript configuration specifically for building
 * the Angular application. It includes application-specific entry points and

 * - Define entry points for client and server builds
 * - Set up build-specific output directories and type definitions
 * - Include necessary files for both SSR and client-side builds
 * - Optimize compilation settings for application deployment
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Extends base tsconfig.json configuration
 * - Node.js type definitions for server-side code
 * - Specific entry points for client and server bootstrapping
 * - Build-optimized output directory structure
 * - Include patterns for source file compilation
